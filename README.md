## OpenCV Webcam Filters 
Create realtime fun colour changing backgrounds for any webcam or movie source, or create
a sketch drawn effect, or pixelate the cam, many interesting possibilities.   

### Requirements & Packages
* Python 3.7+ (tested on 3.11)
* Set up venv then: $ pip install -r requirements.txt 

### Example: Cel-Shaded Colours
Running the filter with changing hue, light pixelation and colour reduction, the following effect can be achieved:

### Example: Pixelated Colours
Further changes to pixel window size can show this effect: 

<img src="Examples/colour_gif_1.gif" alt="Nice" width="500">

### Example: Sketch Filter
Next, we show the sketch filter, that recreates the image as a drawing.
