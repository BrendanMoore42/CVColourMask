## OpenCV Webcam Filters 
Create realtime fun colour changing backgrounds for any webcam or movie source, or create
a sketch drawn effect, or pixelate the cam, many interesting possibilities.   

### Requirements & Packages
* Python 3.7+ (tested on 3.11)
* Set up venv then: $ pip install -r requirements.txt 

### Example: Colours
We run the filter to change the hue, pixelate and reduce the colours to get a cel-shaded effect.

### Example: Sketch Filter
Next, we show the sketch filter, that recreates the image as a drawing.
